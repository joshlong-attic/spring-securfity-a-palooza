# Spring Security Palooza

NB: there are sometimes `readme.md` files in each subfolder, too. be sure to consult them for more on the demo flow and approach.

## Agenda

* `basics`
* `ssl`
* `passkeys`
* `auth-server`

## resources
* [the Spring Security Livelessons that Rob and I did years ago](https://github.com/spring-security-livelessons). not sure how relevant that is in the modern world.
