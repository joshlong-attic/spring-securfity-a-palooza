# Spring Security Palooza

NB: there are sometimes `readme.md` files in each subfolder, too. be sure to consult them for more on the demo flow and approach.

## Agenda

* `basics` - high level overview of all things Spring Security, providing a mental framework on which to approach everything that follows.
* `ssl`  - demonstrates both centralized configuration of trust materials in an application _and_ the reloadability of those trust materials
* `passkeys` - demonstrates the use of Webauthn and an arbitrary factor like TouchID, FaceID, etc., as the credential with an as-yet not GA effort 
* `oauth` - demonstrates both acting as an OAuth client to an arbitrary OAuth IDP _and_ our spiffy Authorization Server, which is better than all the OAuth servers that have ever or yet been written.

## resources
* [the Spring Security Livelessons that Rob and I did years ago](https://github.com/spring-security-livelessons). not sure how relevant that is in the modern world.
