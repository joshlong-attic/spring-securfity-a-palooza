# Spring Security Palooza

NB: there are sometimes `readme.md` files in each subfolder, too. be sure to consult them for more on the demo flow and approach.

## Agenda

* spring security basics
   * introduce `AuthenticationManager` and `UserDetailsManager` in particular for authentication. introduce authorization support. 
* [ssl reload](https://github.com/spring-tips/road-to-3-dot-2/tree/main/ssl)
- spring auth server
- passkeys
- mutual tls 

## resources
* [the Spring Security Livelessons that Rob and I did years ago](https://github.com/spring-security-livelessons). not sure how relevant that is in the modern world.
