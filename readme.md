# Spring Security Palooza

NB: there are sometimes `readme.md` files in each subfolder, too. be sure to consult them for more on the demo flow and approach.

## Agenda

* spring security basics
   * introduce `AuthenticationManager` and `UserDetailsManager` in particular 
   * for authentication. introduce authorization support. 
* `ssl`
- `passkeys`
- spring auth server

## resources
* [the Spring Security Livelessons that Rob and I did years ago](https://github.com/spring-security-livelessons). not sure how relevant that is in the modern world.
